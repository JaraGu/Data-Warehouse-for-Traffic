                                                    Overview

Traffic Data Warehouse repository! This project aims to create a scalable data warehouse for the city traffic department to host vehicle trajectory data collected by swarm UAVs (drones) and static roadside cameras. The data will be used to improve traffic flow in the city and support various undisclosed projects.

                                                        Data
The vehicle trajectory data is sourced from the pNEUMA dataset, an open large-scale collection of naturalistic trajectories of half a million vehicles. The data was gathered through a unique experiment using a swarm of drones in the congested downtown area of Athens, Greece. Each file represents a single (area, date, time) and is approximately 87MB in size.
